# CRA
Course Rating Assistant, Automation of the Golf Course Rating Process

This is the Windows 10 version of CRA Refered to as W10CRA
Visual Studio and Visual Basic are its tools.

Parts of this software are used to create a Libary (dll) to be used in MobileCRA.
I do this with Visual Studio on my machine and include the result in MobileCRA resources.
Any change to the "Backing Logic" is added to the CRALib
